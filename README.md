Overview
This project introduces an Advanced Sensor-Based Autonomous Vehicle System aimed at enhancing road safety by providing proactive collision avoidance and overtaking alerts. Unlike AI-based models, this system relies on sensor data for autonomous decision-making. At the core of this system is the Arduino Uno microcontroller, managing a network of sensors and actuators to address crucial safety issues on the road.

Features
Collision Detection: Utilizes impact and tilt sensors for rapid responses to collisions, along with ADXL accelerometers for accurate detection of potential rollovers.
Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring of sensor data to enable prompt warnings to the driver based on potential risks.
Emergency Response Coordination: Facilitates emergency response coordination by automatically alerting relevant authorities in the event of an accident and providing precise location data.
Injury Mitigation: Incorporates sensors to detect pinching injuries, enabling swift response mechanisms to minimize injury severity.
Smart Turning: Utilizes sensors for smart turning, providing real-time feedback to drivers for safer maneuvering.
Problem Statement
The persistently high incidence of road accidents necessitates the development of more efficient accident prevention and response systems. The goal is to significantly elevate road safety standards and safeguard lives by implementing proactive interventions.

Solution
The integration of advanced sensor-based techniques, including blind spot detection, smart assistance systems, and window closure monitoring, can significantly enhance road safety. These technologies provide real-time alerts to drivers, monitor traffic conditions, and enable swift response mechanisms to mitigate road risks effectively.
